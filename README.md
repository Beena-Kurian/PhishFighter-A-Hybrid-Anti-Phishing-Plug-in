# PhishFighter-A-Hybrid-Anti-Phishing-Plug-in
PhishFighter is an intelligent, real-time anti-phishing browser plug-in developed as part of my M.Tech thesis project. It combines blacklist filtering, lexical URL analysis, visual similarity detection, and textual content verification to accurately identify phishing websites and protect users during browsing.

üîç Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Instantly detects phishing websites using a multi-phase hybrid detection framework.

Multi-Layered Defense:

Phase I: Blacklist verification and lexical URL feature analysis.

Phase II: Form tag detection to determine potential phishing threats.

Phase III: Visual similarity checking using OpenCV (EMD algorithm), textual content matching, and URL scheme validation.

High Accuracy: Achieved 97.8% accuracy on a dataset of 500 URLs with zero false positives.

Tech Stack: Google Chrome Extension (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Python (OpenCV), Django Backend.

User Interaction: Includes a user-friendly interface with safety indicators and a companion reporting website.
